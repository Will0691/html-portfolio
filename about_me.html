            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>
                If you're hoping to read the juicy details of my innermost secrets, sorry, but there isn't much to say. <br>
                I was born in the late 1900s, bore witness to the turn of the milennium, and have lived through multiple decades. <br>
                Now I am just another guy in California with a PC. <br>
                You won't be getting anything out of me about my family, or my friends, or who I may be in a relationship with...

            <h1>Interests / Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                I enjoy wasting time watching random videos and looking at random images on the internet which have absolutely no educational value and provide no intellectual stimulation at all.
                <br>
                These are commonly referred to by recent generations as "memes."
                <br>
                I also enjoy staying up way too late, which has caused me to become dependent on caffeine to function in the morning.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because I live a sedentary lifestyle, I also try to make time to attend the gym a few times a week to try staying in shape (but I'm too lazy)
                <br>
                <br>
                Of course I am also working on my programming skills.

            <h1>Why web development?</h1>
            <p>
                It just seemed like the right fit for me.
                <br>
                I have always been good with computers, and ever since I was young I had always been curious about programming.
                <br>
                When I was a child, I made my own games with GameMaker. Then I eventually moved on to C++ and later C# as I taught myself real programming languages.
                <br>
                I even taught myself python specifically to be able to make mods for one of my games, and I figured I should put this knowledge to use in a way that's actually productive.
                <br>
                I already have some knowledge, and I have always been a quick learner, so I figured I should put those traits of mine to good use.
